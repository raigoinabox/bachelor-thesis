\subsection{Programming language}

Programming language is a formal language with a set of rules about how the
computer should behave. Programming languages usually have syntax and semantics.
The syntax of the language is usually considered the grammar of the language.
For example, if there is a syntax problem in the program, the computer doesn't
understand the command and stops. The semantics of the language is considered to
be the vocabulary and meaning of the language. If there is a semantical problem,
then the program is valid and understandable to the computer, but it is not what
the programmer wished to happen. The program will react rather unpredictably.
Syntactic sugar is a feature that the programmer can easily implement it in the
language and is there for the convenience.\cite{website:syntax-semantics}

Any sufficiently complex program or programming language needs to hold and
manipulate data. Because holding and manipulating only bits and bytes is
uncomfortable and prone to errors, more abstraction is required. Dividing the
data into different types will help with ease of use and early detection of
errors. A type is the upper bound of a range of values that a variable can
assume. In a typed language a variable can be given a nontrivial type while in
untyped languages a variable is not limited to a type. Strongly checked
languages will give an error in case of mistyping and weakly checked languages
will not check for such errors and might produce type-related bugs. Statically
checked languages check for type errors during compile time and dynamically
checked languages will check during the runtime.\cite{cardelli96}

Programming languages are usually divided into two categories: high level
languages and low level languages. The difference is that low level languages
are designed more around how the computer works, while high level languages are
designed more around the productivity of the programmer. Because high level
languages need to do more translation between what the programmer wants and what
the computer accepts, they are usually slower than low level languages. Another
advantage of lower level languages is that they enable the programmer to have
better access to specific operations and more understanding how the program is
executed. This is very useful when the main goal is
optimisation.\cite{website:scripting-languages}

Python is a widely-used, general-purpose programming language as shown in figure
\ref{python-popularity}. Python focuses on human readability, simplicity and
power to the
programmer.\cite{website:python-zen,website:python-faq-creation-reason} That
fact is most likely best expressed by the fact that Python uses indentation to
divide its blocks. A language like C uses the curly braces for that and uses the
indentation only for clarity of reading. Python, however, forces the programmer
to make the program more readable and standardised. Semantically Python is very
flexible. It supports functional, object-oriented and procedural programming
styles.

Python uses dynamic typing, also called duck typing. Duck typing doesn't check
if an object implements some certain interface, but simply tries to call the
method or attribute. The principle is ``If it looks like a duck and quacks like
a duck, it must be a duck''.\cite[duck-typing]{website:python-glossary} This
method of type checking renders interfaces useless.

% Python has two running modes: the interactive mode and the script mode. The
% interactive mode is a read-eval-print loop. It reads the user supplied
% \emph{expression} and parses it into a data structure, evaluates it and prints
% the result. An expression can't be multiline and must return only one value.
% Evaluating a value will return that value, evaluating a variable returns the
% contents of the variable and evaluating a function will call that function with
% the arguments and returns the result of the function. The script running mode is
% similar to the interactive mode, but instead of the user, the expressions are
% taken from a file and when the end of the file is reached, the interpreter
% terminates.
